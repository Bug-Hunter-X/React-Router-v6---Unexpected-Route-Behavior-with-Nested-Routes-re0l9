This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router DOM v6 where a route with the same path as a parent route does not render.  The issue occurs when nesting routes and a child route has a path that overlaps with a parent route. The solution involves carefully examining route paths for overlap and potential ambiguity.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version.
